-> cache current population,
allow for hand tuning of step size


-> really need to make sure that it is covering the entire search space. FOr the 3 bar tensegrity I would expect it to find a tensegrity configuration quite fast.....

-> select bars unfiromly from 0 to length in the mutation step

-> user input to dynamically change step size....

-> impose symetry by flipping during mutation......

-> allow for caching and then displaying of the solution afterwards
